<p>The uvuyo gateway is build based on java version 12. It runs on all major Linux systems including Ubuntu, Red Hat and Suse which are not out of support by their suppliers. For the Telefonica installation we chose to use RHEL 7.9 for the test and production system. Before upgrading or switching to new OS versions in production, the upgrade should be performed and tested in the test environment. This should not just include the upgrading process of the operating system, but also must include the functional testing of the adapter itself.</p>

<p>Customers must ensure that all security fixes are installed in time on the test and the production environment.</p>

<p>No Database is required to run the uvuyo gateway</p>
